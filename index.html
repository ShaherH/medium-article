      <h2>Waiting Patiently...</h2>
      <p>
        Having personally visited/lived in 5 MENA region countries myself, I think there is so much promise and opportunity in the Arab world. Unfortunately, as most people know, there are many problems here.  One problem that seems to constantly be present in all the places I’ve lived (USA, China, MENA region) is when things seem to be working within a group, others want to take from them.  For example, someone decides to open a coffee shop in Palestine and happens to be successful for the first 6 months.  The team is happy and working well together.  Suddenly, another business person begins to frequently visit the shop for his 2NIS coffee. Never spending more than 2NIS when he does his daily 3 hour visit and constantly wants to sit and talk to the staff/chef of the cafe.  Why? Because he’s trying to get them to like him in order to persuade them to work in his new cafe down the street, which is still being renovated.  He promises to give them higher pay and better conditions if they leave their job, and some eventually do.  I’ve witnesses this many times. Most fail.  While the original business owner struggles in the beginning from key staff departures, ultimately, he/she finds a way to deal with it because his/her reputation is well know in the community.

        Reputation is extremely important anywhere in the world.  I’ve worked in many hacking events around the world where team members would advise me to stay away from certain people at the event because they were lazy or greedy.  In the USA, the saying is a “Dog eat dog world” but eventually, your turn to be eaten will come.  Usually, when that happens, the people you’ve treated right along the way will stand by you.

      <h2>Swooping In...</h2>
      <p>
        Going up to a tech or business cofounder, whispering in their ear about your project you need help with just to lead them on.  Its being selfish, its being lazy and its being very sneaky. Don’t stab each other in the back. Don’t look for a chance to pounce when you see a weakness in others.  Don’t think that you are doing the business owner(s) a favor by focusing on one of their possible features and thinking it will lead to future collaboration. That business owner already thought of your idea and is probably 10 steps ahead of you.   Instead of watching to see who is a success and trying to take their ideas/team members, find ways to help each other.  Offering them suggestions on how to improve.  Share your contacts and resources.  Positive things will only come by doing so.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        Money is very important in most peoples lives.  Gotta keep paying them bills.  Team members tend to follow leaders who are closer to closing a deal with an investor or have already received investment.  If not, they’ll search for the next savvy entrepreneur to follow.  However, investors aren’t just looking for a product to work and make money.  They want to see sustainability and a team that clicks.  That doesn’t happen overnight.  Don’t be a startup vulture.
